#  SkyWatch
##  **Description**

SkyWatch is a weather dashboard application that allows users to retrieve current and 5-day weather forecasts for multiple cities using the OpenWeather API. The application provides real-time weather data, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, and weather conditions, and stores previously searched cities for quick access.

**Key Features**

* Fetches real-time weather data using OpenWeather API.
* Displays current weather conditions, including city name, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and an icon representation of weather.
* Provides a 5-day weather forecast for the searched city.
* Stores previously searched cities in a history list for easy access.
* Enables users to retrieve and delete stored searches.
* Responsive and intuitive user interface.

**Technology Stack**

* **Front-End:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, TypeScript, Vite
* **Back-End:** Node.js, Express, TypeScript
* **API Integration:** OpenWeather API (Geocoder, 5 Day Forecast)
* **Storage:** JSON-based search history file

## Installation

This application is [live](https://skywatch-ldos.onrender.com), but you can also install it on your own machine. To set up and run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Dependencies**:
	Before installing, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
	* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
	* npm (Comes bundled with Node.js)
	* TypeScript (Installed as a dependency in this project)
   
2.  **Clone the Repo**:
	Clone the [SkyWatch](https://github.com/alexis-menendez/SkyWatch) repository to your local machine:
	* Open a terminal or command prompt and run:
	```sh
	git clone <(https://github.com/alexis-menendez/SkyWatch)>
	```

3. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory: (your path may vary)
   ```sh
   cd /c/Bootcamp/GitHub/SkyWatch
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**: (skip this step if you have already installed the dependencies)
   Run the following command to install all required dependencies for both the client and server:
   ```sh
   npm run install
   ```

5. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the server directory and add your OpenWeather API key:
   ```sh
   echo "API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key" > server/.env
   ```

6. **Build the project**:
   Navigate to the server directory and build the project:
   ```sh
   cd server
   npm run build
   ```

7. **Run the application**:
   Start the server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

8. **Run the client**:
   Open a second terminal, navigate to the client directory, and start the client:
   ```sh
   cd /c/Bootcamp/GitHub/SkyWatch/client
   npm run dev
   ```

This will start both the server and the client, and you should be able to access your application in the browser.

## Usage

1. Run the application using command:
	* npm start
2. Enter a city name in the search bar and click Search.
3. View the current weather conditions and the 5-day forecast.
4. Click on any city in the search history to view its weather data again.
5. Delete a city from the search history if needed.

## Deployment

This project is deployed on [Render](https://render.com/) to make it accessible online.

### Live Application
You can access the deployed SkyWatch application here:  
ðŸ”— **[SkyWatch Live Deployment](https://skywatch-ldos.onrender.com)**  

### How Deployment Works
- The backend (server) is deployed as a **Render Web Service**.
- The frontend (client) is deployed as a **Render Static Site**.
- The application is automatically updated with each new commit to the GitHub repository.

## API Calls

When a user searches for a city, the application follows this process to retrieve and display weather data:

- In the browser, when you click the "Search" button, the **Client** grabs the city name you typed and calls the **Backend Server**
- The **Server** grabs the city name from the **Client** and uses it to call the **[Open Weather Geocoder Api](https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api)**  
- The **[Open Weather Geocoder Api](https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api)** converts the city name into latitude and logitude data
- The **Server** grabs the latitude and logitude data from the **[Open Weather Geocoder API](https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api)** and uses it to call the **[Open Weather 5 Day Forecast API](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5)**
- The **Server** grabs the forecast data from the **[Open Weather 5 Day Forecast API](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5)**
- The **Server** saves the data in json storage
- The **Server** sends the data to frontend

## Acknowledgements

1. I used Github Copilot to help me write the code for this project, primarily its suggestive text feature which enabled me to write code faster.

2. I also used ChatGPT to:
  	* Provide assitance debugging my code. I am happy to provide transcripts of the conversation with ChatGPT upon request.
  	* Review my completed project and offer suggestions for improvement.
  	* Create detailed explanations for certain concepts which informed my writing.
  	* Create comments explaining parts of my code (this ended up being more of a bane than a boon as it also rewrote sections of my code without me realizing which broke things, lesson learned!)

3. I enlisted the help of a friend (and former participant of this bootcamp) to help me when I hit snags.

4. Lastly, I literally could not have completed this project without help from Robin ([Zomblic](https://github.com/zomblic)), a fellow bootcamper and the savior of my sanity. She quickly found the syntax errors in my code that were breaking everything and helped me get up and running. Couldn't have done it without her!
